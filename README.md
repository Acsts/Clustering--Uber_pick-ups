# Uber pickups clustering in NYC

_Unsupervised Machine Learning project submitted for certification of my Full-Stack Data Science training with Jedha Bootcamp_

## Introduction

In order to advise Uber drivers on where to be at which time, the goal of this project is to identify "hot-zones" (in time and space) from Uber pick-up requests data, and display theses zones on a map.  

## Input Data and Scope


The data provided for this project gathers Uber pick-uprequests in NYC from april to september 2014 and from january to june 2015, available [here](https://full-stack-bigdata-datasets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Machine+Learning+non+Supervis%C3%A9/Projects/uber-trip-data.zip). 
This analysis focuses on April 2014 data. 

## Usage

### Visualizing analysis results without code

If you want to access the results of the analysis without running any line of code, all interactive visualizations are accessible in the 'results' folder, in the form of .html files you can open with your web browser. 

These files corresponds to the outputs obtained from running the code in the notebook. 

### Code

All code is gathered in one notebook 'Uber pickups clustering.ipynb', and is written in Python3.  

#### Prerequisites
1. Install python
2. The python packages can be installed with pip : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
